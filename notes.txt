Procedures:
- invite participants and let them sign up for a session in hroot
- get their email addresses
- assign participant labels randomly
- for each participant label, there is a pre-determined role for each game
- when we start a new session, the config file is loaded. The file specifies the role for each player in each game
- in the end, we can easily calculate payoffs etc.
- this method ensures that we have equal numbers in each role
